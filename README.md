# FinTech - Case Study

# [FIRMEX](https://www.firmex.com/)

## Overview and Origin

Firmex is a Toronto based company that provides secure document sharing SaaS solution consisting of Virtual Data Rooms for M&A deals, law firms, investment banks, and corporations. Firmex's Virtual Data Rooms facilitates sharing of large volumes of confidential documents inclusive of financial transactions, litigation and compliance across a wide set of industries.

Firmex was founded in 2006 and its founder and CEO was Joel Lessem. An interview with Joel Lessem provides insights into his philosophies on salesmanship [salesmanship](https://www.salestalentagency.com/blog/great-sales-leaders-know-firmex/) which is one of the key factors attributed to Firmex's organic growth. The idea of Firmex came from his extensive experience in working with entrepreneurs and a need to provide a secure way to manage documents for M&A for startup companies. It is also important to note that Joel was one of the few entrepreneurs who was  [disinclined to continuous fundraising](https://financialpost.com/entrepreneur/fp-startups/why-startups-should-consider-turning-away-the-big-bucks-of-venture-capitalists) especially if the company is profitable.

Firmex has had a total funding rounds of approximately $4.5M according to  [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/firmex) and had five (5) major rounds of investment with the latest funding executed on Feb 5, 2019. Two major investors were Novacap (Private Equity Round) and Klass Capital (Seed Round).

On July 26, 2021, Firmex was acquired by Datasite, also a SaaS platform company that provides global M&A solutions ["across the entire deal lifecycle."](https://www.datasite.com/us/en/company/news/press-releases/datasite-announces-acquisition-of-toronto-based-firmex-.html) Prior to this acquisition, Firmex majority shareholders were 
[Vertu Capital](https://vertucapital.ca/), BDC Capital and Firmex's management team. Vertu and BDC had acquired a majority stake in Firmex from Quebec investor Novacap.

## Business Activities

Firmex provides Virtual Data Rooms that are relevant for specific industries, namely:

- Investment Banking
- Corporate
- Biotech & Pharma
- Government & Infrastructure
- Mining
- Renewable Energy
- Oil & Gas
- Legal
- Private Equity
- Real Estate

Firmex's intended customers include legal firms, investment banks who execute deals, financial services, real estate, corporations, private equity (LPs) and any entity that requires a private virtual solution for document exchange in a secure manner. The market served by Firmex product includes [23% small businesses (<50 employees), 33% medium businesses and 39% large enterprises (>1000 employees)](https://enlyft.com/tech/products/firmex).

Competitive advantage of Firmex are the people and its non-leadership driven [culture](https://www.prweb.com/releases/firmex_wins_gold_stevie_award_for_customer_service_department_of_the_year/prweb18400959.htm). It is very important to note that the [Customer Support](https://www.firmex.com/support/) and Sales functions of Firmex are very much touted in the industry.  This is important because many of the smaller and larger firms were not extremely tech savvy in 2006. Onboarding with Sales and Customer Support allowed Firmex to grow the client base organically and as a result the revenue.  As of 2022, the acquisition of Firmex by Datasite stands the test of time of a simple user experience augmented by direct customer contact.  This relationship driven competitive advantage can be hard to replicate by competitors who are heavy on tech and light on people-centricity. 

But recently Firmex has also taken the initiative to augment their products with improvements and new [releases](https://support.firmex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001535873?utm_source%3Dhomepage%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_campaign%3Dproduct_updates%26_ga%3D2.117304262.196435269.1668977768-1746532754.1668977768#new-improved-0-1). Personally, I like the transparency provided in simple updates by Firmex. But as is always the case, there is room for improvements as noted on [Capterra reviews](https://www.capterra.ca/reviews/131320/firmex-virtual-data-rooms).

The Virtual Data Rooms is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with data centres in US, Canada and Germany. In addition, there are other monitoring, marketing, messaging, feedback and cusotmer support solutions [stack](https://www.firmex.com/sub-processors/) used for managing the VDRs.  One thing missing from the stack is the security structure but perhaps that is an intentional ommission. 

## Landscape

Firmex covers several domains of the financial industry as the Vitual Data Rooms solutions allows for broader coverage of use cases.  The domains include:

- Investment Mgmt
- Enterprise Solutions
- Smart Contracts (Blockchain)
- Real Estate

As the product solution is extended further, it is likely that Firmex can encompass other domains.  It isn't clear from the research conducted if Firmex applies Smart Contract solutions based on Blockchain directly in their solution but they do recommend use of [Extranets](https://www.firmex.com/resources/blog/three-tips-running-successful-legal-client-extranet/).

Virtual Data Rooms market has a reported market size of [USD $1.58 Billion in 2019 and is expected to grow to USD $4.12 Billion by 2027 with a CAGR of 14.7%](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/virtual-data-room-market). Features and market opportunities for this product in the coming years include:
- AI and Non-AI Powered solutions
- Consulting, Integration, Training, Support
- Cloud based expansion as well as on-premise solutions
- Use cases may extend to Marketing and Sales as well as Workforce Management
- Vertical applications can extend to Healthcare and Life Sciences, Compliance Agencies and Industrial IP
- Further expansion of the market to Asia Pacific and Latin America

Firmex's competitors in the market include the following:
- Intralinks
- Citrix ShareFile
- Egnyte
- DealRoom
- ShareVault
- Box
- Dropbox DocSend
- SecureDocs, An Onit Product
- Digify
- DealRoom
and several others.

Given the scale of market opportunity for Virtual Data Rooms, there is fragmentation in the competitive products as solution customize to specific industry verticals.  Also, given the upcoming recession in 2022/2023, there may be an opportunity to consolidate customized offerings into a larger solution by a larger company.

## Results

Firmex has a [revenue of $11.2M in 2022 with approximately 4K customers](https://getlatka.com/companies/firmex) and there is still opportunity for growth.  So overall it is a viable business and there is upside growth anticipated as the solution can be further engineered for growth.

Firmex's peak revenue was $20.0M in 2021 and had 134 employees. So with a revenue of $149,253 per employee, it is viable business with a positive growth outlook even in the current recessionary market.


## Recommendations

My general recommendation for this product would be to expand the application into other vertical market or customize solutions for the most lucrative industries; whichever has a higher ROI. The following are some of my recommendations:

- There is a need to further invest in product at feature level as the UI/UX seems to require additional bells and whistles based on client [feedback](https://www.capterra.ca/reviews/131320/firmex-virtual-data-rooms).  This should help retain existing clients in the most lucrative industries. 

- The product team should explore industry-specific integrations with technologies that are commonly used within the specified industry.  ROI will have to be analyzed before these integrations can be developed.  There will also be a need to conduct due-diligence from a security perspective to ensure integration with other technologies is a feasible opportunity and will not distrupt the core features of the solution.  The analysis may also furhter help clarify if the strategy for Firmex should be market expansion or vertical market customization.

- Application of Smart Contracts may also help to enhance the offering. A prototype or a pilot might help determine how Smart Contracts (using Blockchain) can be applied securely and within the required legal, private, secure, compliant and technological parameters. Currently the product only seems to adhere to a document sharing objective.  Smart Contracts can expand the product features to contract clause adherance between parties rather than a simple dcoument exchange solution.

## Conclusion

Firmex was an organic startup in a market that reamins lucrative even in recessionary times. There is still significant opportunity to serve the market with the Virtual Data Rooms by enhancing the technology, proliferating larger platforms to grow customer base, and further customize the solution to client needs.
